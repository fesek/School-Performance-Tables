Script parsing school performance data available from the UK's Department of Education's website and mapping the results using Google Maps.

After geocoding the school's postcode, a marker is placed on the map representing the school's performance in English and Math. Additional key values are displayed in a pop up.

The entire process is offline. Geocoding can be done in a separate step and cached in a local file for future reuse without abusing Google's API limitations. Downloaded CSV files are read from a dedicated directory. The result is represented as JSON objects in a separate Javascript file containing basic code to hook up with Google Maps and placing markers. This in turn is included from an HTML file.

Notes:
*There is certainly potential for refactoring and additional customization.
*You may need to generate and add you own Google API key to the html file.
*Fetch files from the "Download all" columns of the page below. The script has been used with "KS2", KS4 and KS5 are untested.

Sample invocation:
  ./lookup.py  -d data/ -o london.js -l geocode_cache 

Files:
